After few days of struggling, I've finally build up this blog, so I'd like to share with you how I did this, and what are the work-arounds for some issue I encountered.

### Environment
- Linux Subsystem on Windows 10
- GitHub
- Jekyll
- Visual Studio Code

These are the tools I used. Make sure you got the same thing as I do if you also want to build a blog like this one.
